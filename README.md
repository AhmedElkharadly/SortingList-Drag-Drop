This is my solution for this task:
    Problem
        ● Our application contain a list of items.
        ● We need to make these items sortable.
        Requirements
        ● Implement drag and drop sortable items list.
        ● Return an array of objects ( id and order pairs ) in the following format. Make this happen
        every time the user changes any item's order by dragging and dropping it.
        ex:
            [
                {
                    "id": 1,
                    "order": 5
                },
                {
                    "id": 2,
                    "order": 3
                }
            ]
    Notes.
        ● Concider clean code
        ● Consider application performance.
        ● Consider the structure of the files. 

So I made this Code Using just React without any liberaries.
you can run the Code With 
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
